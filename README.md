 The following codes are written in Wolfram Mathematica (v.12). They calculate and plot the trajectory of a particle around a:

part_orbit_Schwarzschild -> Schwarzschild black hole

part_orbit_Kerr_equatorial -> Kerr black hole, 2D trajectories on the BH equatorial plane

part_orbit_Kerr -> Kerr black hole, 3D trajectories
